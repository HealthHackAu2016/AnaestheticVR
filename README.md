Health Hack 2016

Zhao and I have no design or development experience, so we had to make do with what resources we could gather online. We managed to produce a working prototype by piecing together license free videos and sound bites from NASA and turning the video into a stereoscopic format with InstaVR. InstaVR then exported the files in an app format to ANDROID/IOS.

Research

Personal experience from Zhao and George (work for NSW Health) almost every day they face a child who is distressed when undergoing anaesthetic. 

Just looking around online - the estimates have high variance
Roughly 5% of children in Australia are anaesthetised each year,
there's approx 4.8 million kids in Aus (< 18 y.o.) -
which gives approx 240,000 episodes of anaesthesia per year
- majority are GAs.

Most tertiary paediatric hospital anaesthetic departments
15-20,000 episodes of care per year, again majority would be GAs.

Most common type of paediatric surgery requiring anaesthetic care =
- adenoids and tonsils
- various gen surg (hernias, appendices, etc)
- ORIFs, lumps, bumps
At the Royal Children's Hospital Melbourne, the above 3 categories
account for almost 50% of all surgeries performe.

Pre-op anxiety is associated with many bad outcomes

Arch Pediatr Adolesc Med. 1996 Dec;150(12):1238-45.
They found majority of children exhibit pre-op anxiety. Adverse
effects are continued at follow up.

"Overall, 54% of children exhibited some negative behavioral responses
at the 2-week follow-up
Twenty percent of the children continued to demonstrate negative
behavior changes at 6-month follow-up,
and, in 7.3% of the children, these behaviors persisted at 1-year follow-up.
Nightmares, separation anxiety, eating problems, and increased fear of
physicians
were the most common problems at 2-week follow-up. "

Another review article quoted verbatim:

A majority of children experience significant stress and anxiety
before surgery.[1]
Studies have demonstrated an association between preoperative anxiety
and adverse
postoperative clinical outcomes, such as emergence delirium, increased
analgesic
requirements, and negative behavioural changes (e.g. bed-wetting,
altered appetite,
sleep disturbance, and separation anxiety).[1 â€“ 3] Alarmingly some of
these behavioural
changes can persist for months into the postoperative period.
Therefore, in order to
improve the perioperative course of these children, it is essential
that measures are
taken to relieve their anxiety.

In the United States, approximately 450,000 children under 18 years of
age are admitted for surgery as inpatients annually. One quarter of
these children are under 3 years of age and the majority for
gastrointestinal, orthopedic, or urological surgery.
